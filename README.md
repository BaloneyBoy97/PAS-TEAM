									# Team AirView

# **Description**

Air View is a Web Application that connects the flights to its customers (ie) it is a platform for users to book flights, check-in their baggage and download their boarding passes in their local airport. This is a system to use for airport operations instead of a third party booking service or airline check in system.

# **Objective :**
The objective of this project is to create a centralized system for airport management; normally, customers use third party booking services to book flights and check in at the airport using airline services. The goal of this project is to create a system which allows customers to book flights, check in luggages, and receive e-tickets within the application operated by airports.
